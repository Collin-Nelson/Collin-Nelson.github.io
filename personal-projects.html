			<h3> 3D Printer 2018 </h3>

				My first significant engineering project was building a 3D printer during my third and fourth years of high school. It took me a year to 
				research, design, and build the first version, but this early prototype was only capable of crude prints with poor surface quality. After another 
				year of testing, evaluating, and refinment, I was able to achieve high print quality and dimensional accuracy with a second revision of the printer 
				and significant work in tuning the print parameters. While this revision printed much better, it began to have issues with the axes binding mid-print 
				on longer prints. This led to several failed prints before I identified the method of binding. In my first year of college, I was then able to design 
				another revision that avoided this binding issue. I have since moved on to other projects, but continue to infrequently modify the design of this 
				printer to improve its performance.
