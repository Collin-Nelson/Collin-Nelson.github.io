			<h3> Robot in Three Days 2021 </h3>

			<p class="projects-p">
				In three days, we revised our robot from Ri3D 2020 to better acomplish the 2021 challenge, which was similar to 2020's challenge due to COVID-19. 
				I led the build team to fix our ball intake system, repair the pnumatics, build and mount a mechanism to shoot balls, and install a gyroscope. 
				We worked slowly because of the additional distancing and sanitation requirements imposed by COVID, as well as having a significantly smaller team 
				spread over multiple locations across Raliegh and North Carolina. We worked hard to effectively communicate between workshops, utilizing 
				walkie-talkies and a remote CAD team to help each build site understand how different components would fit together on the final robot. Our 
				biggest challenge was designing components to fit together properly, as everything fabricated at the remote sites couldn't be brought to the 
				main space until the last day.

			<h3> Robot in Three Days 2020 </h3>
			<img src="/images/placeholder.png" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				Faced with a multifaceted challenge, we devised strategy to score the most points, ideated mechanisms, and built a functioning robot in three 
				days. This was our first time trying to build a robot in three days and the semester began halfway through, but we were still able to finish 
				and mount most of the mechanisms to the robot. We developed a system to pull balls in over the robot's outer frame and required "bumpers," then 
				transport balls through the middle of the robnot to be ejected into a goal several feet higher at the other end of the robot. We also had a 
				mechanism that extended to rotate a wheel above the robot until it detected the correct color. The final system was a climbing system that used 
				a latching hook that detached from an extendable arm when the winch began hoisting the robot off the ground. This climbing system, however, was 
				not able to be mounted before we ran out of time. We went through the engineering design process, first identifying the tasks we wanted to 
				accomplish, then designing mechanical systems out of the material on hand. We then tested and revised our designs until we developed a functioning 
				system.
