			<h3> Robot in Three Days 2021 </h3>
			<img src="/images/placeholder.png" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				In three days, we revised our robot from Ri3D 2020 to better acomplish the 2021 challenge, which was similar to 2020's challenge due to COVID-19. 
				I led the build team to fix our ball intake system, repair the pnumatics, build and mount a mechanism to shoot balls, and install a gyroscope. 
				We worked slowly because of the additional distancing and sanitation requirements imposed by COVID, as well as a significantly smaller team 
				spread over multiple locations across Raliegh, and even across the state. We worked hard to effectively communicate between workshops, utilizing 
				walkie-talkies and a remote CAD team to help each build site understand how different components would fit together on the final robot. Our 
				biggest challenge was designing components to fit together properly, as everything fabricated at the remote sites couldn't be brought to the 
				main space until the last day.
