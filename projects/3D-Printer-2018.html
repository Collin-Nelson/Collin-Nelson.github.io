			<h3> Here's some info about how I built a 3D printer </h3>
			<p>
				
				I have been working on individual engineering projects since my third year of high school, when I began my first 3D printer. That project 
				took me a year to design, build, and start printing crude prints, however the tolerances were poor on those initial prints. It took 
				another year of refining the design to ultimately get a 3D printer that was able to print well. After a number of prints, I began to have
				issues with the axies binding and the steppers skipping in the middle of large prints. I then then realized that my use of ball-bearing 
				rollers on aluminum extrusion was a flawed linear motion system, as the tolerance on the distance between the rollers was to large.
				This meant that the angle between the axes was loose, and the plates that wrapped around the extrusion to connect the rollers above and 
				below it were able to bind against the extrusion. This caused the issues with reliability on large prints.
			</p>
			<p>
				For my next design, I chose to position the carrige between two beams of aluminum extrusion, instead of around one. This eliminated the 
				binding issue, and also allowed me to better tension the carrage by changing the distance between the extrusion beams. In this design, I 
				also moved the stepper motors inside the cube of the frame to make transporting the printer easier, as well as facilitate enclosing the 
				printer with foam insulation at a later date.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also worked on some modifications to the electrical system as part of my printer overhaul. The biggest change was modifying an ATX 
				(desktop computer) power supply to better run my Arduino-based hardware. The printer requires primarily 12v power, but the display and 
				logic circuits use 5v power. My first printer design relied on the buck converted built into the Arduino MEGA board to drop the voltage, 
				but my display was flickering because it was not getting sufficient voltage. Becuase of this, I chose to modify the Arduino shield I was 
				using to manage the printer functions to that the 5v power rail was supplied by the ATX power supply, which was designed to power the 
				motherboard of a computer, and so had plenty of power to spare. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With this change, I also had to add a power resistor to the 5v rail of 
				my power supply to balance the load, as the 12v rail's voltage was dipping because the power supply relies on use of the 5v rail to 
				regulate to 12v rail properly. In addition, since I was going to the trouble to set up a better electrical system, I added the wiring 
				to allow my Arduino MEGA to control the power on/off pin of the power supply, which is what the computer uses to tur itself on and off 
				when the power button is pushed. To poroerly use this feature, however, I had to also wire the power stand by line to my electronics, so 
				that the printer would have some power to be able to tell the power supply to turn on.
