			<h2 style="text-align:center"> Summary </h2>
				<p>
					Practical third-year mechanical engineering student with robotics, additive manufacturing, and traditional manufacturing experience. 
					Passionate about engineering with several large individual and group projects completed, including designing and building a large 
					format desktop 3D printer and over 1000 hours designing and fabricating competition robots for the FIRST Robotics Competition.
				</p>
			<h2 style="text-align:center"> A Bit About Me </h2>
				<p>
					I am a university student, undergraduate researcher, and engineer at heart. I enjoy all kinds of engineering project work, but I 
					primarily design and build things I have a need to use in my daily life. My primary motivations for projects are to better understand 
					a system or technology, as well as to challenge myself to build it cheaper or better than what is currently commercially availible, 
					often by leveraging small-scale oppertunities not availibe to commercial manufacturing. I have built everything from a mini-fridge to 
					a 3D printer, and I continue to use and refine these projects as I notice oppertunities for improvement. 
					
				</p>
			<h2 style="text-align:center"> My Favorite Projects </h2>
				<p>
					I struggle to pick a favorite project, as there are aspects of each that I have really enjoyed. My 3D printer is a top pick because 
					it was my first independent engineering project, and I am thrilled at how well it turned out. On the other hand, 
					I really enjoyed the teamwork that characterized my time in FIRST Robotics, and later in Ri3D as a part of the FIRST Alumni Associaction 
					at NC State. I also had a lot of fun trying to use primerily recycled materials when building my minifridge to be an efficient system, 
					but cost less than half what I could buy a similar unit for.
				</p>
				<p>
					... list work things. Outside of my formal responsibilities, I like to ... volenteer, bike, camp, hike, run, read, etc
