			<h3> Cardboard Boat Design Competition </h3>
			<img src="/images/MAE200-Boat-Design-Competition-Cover.jpg" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				As an assignment for MAE 200, we competed in teams of five to design, build, and test a cardboard boat that could carry the most weight 
				using only a triangular piece of poster board and one foot of duct tape. This project was particularly challenging because we were provided 
				a triangular piece of poster board, rather than an easier shape to design around such as a square. This lead us to decide it was best 
				to make a boat shaped as a triangular prism. We maximised the internal volume in order to displace as much water as possible and maximize 
				our weight capacity. We made and tested several prototypes to evaluate stability with load. We learned to mark the center of boyancy and place 
				the weight there evenly. We calculated the boat should be able to hold 11.5 lbs, and it ended up holding just over 13! This project taught me a 
				lot about the design process, how to design within given constraints, and the importance of calculation accuracy.
